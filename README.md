# Post Install Notes

A set of Markdown-formatted documents noting things I do after fresh Linux installs.

Given that I use a couple different Linux distributions these are going to be
separated by which distribution they're central to.

Seriously, that's it.

## Note

It's worth mentioning that I use [XFCE] as a desktop so some of the packages I
choose to install are either specific to XFCE or chosen for being GTK-based
without any GNOME dependencies or fewer GNOME dependencies.
